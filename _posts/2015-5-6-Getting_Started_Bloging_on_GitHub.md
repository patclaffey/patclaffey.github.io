title: Setup of a GitHub Web and Blogging Site
---

I recently setup this web and blogging site using GitHub's web hosting platform.  As a GitHub user I discovered that they provide a free web-site hosting solution for their members.  The also provide a lean agile web development framework called Jekyll for maintaining the website.  An additional incentive from GitHub is they supply a cool personal website url - my url is http://patclaffey.github.io

##Creating a GitHub Web-Site
GitHub provide clear [instructions for creating a web-site]( https://pages.github.com/ ).  A user web-site is created in a GitHub repository with the naming convention username.github.io - in my case patclaffey.github.io.  An index.html file is uploaded to this repository to test the web-site.  A test file is created with the command -  echo "Hello World" > index.html.  I opened my browser at my personal url patclaffey.github.io - and success, my content was displayed in the browser.
