My first ever [blog on Docker](http://patclaffey.github.io/Docker_Bootcamp/) was published by [Docker Weekly](https://goto.docker.com/Docker-Weekly-09302015.html)

I guess it all started with this tweet from [Tom Shaw](https://twitter.com/tomwillfixit)
![Tweet about Docker Bootcamp Blog](/images/tweet_docker_bootcamp.png)

I guess it all started with the [blog about the Demonware Bootcamp](http://patclaffey.github.io/Docker_Bootcamp/)

I guess it all started with the Demonware Docker Bootcamp

Who knew all about it before I did was Peter in Nairobi Kenya
