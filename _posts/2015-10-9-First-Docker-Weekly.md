My first ever [blog on Docker](http://patclaffey.github.io/Docker_Bootcamp/) was published by [Docker Weekly](https://goto.docker.com/Docker-Weekly-09302015.html).

I guess it all started with this tweet from [Tom Shaw](https://twitter.com/tomwillfixit):
![Tweet about Docker Bootcamp Blog](/images/"tweet_docker_bootcamp.png" )

I guess it all started with the [blog about the Demonware Bootcamp](http://patclaffey.github.io/Docker_Bootcamp/)

I guess it all started with the Demonware Docker Bootcamp

Who knew all about it before I did was Peter in Nairobi, Kenya

Who knew all about it before I did was Nic

In the end I know all about it.
